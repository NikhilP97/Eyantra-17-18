# Eyantra 17-18
e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition for undergraduate students in science and colleges. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.
The theme assigned to us was "Harvertor Bot"
In this theme we had to automate a bots traversal to each tree location and using image processing recognize the fruit and size of the fruit. If the fruit was present in the required fruits table, the bot pluckes it from the tree and moves to the depositon zone to drop the fruit. The same process is repeated untill all required fruits are serviced.
